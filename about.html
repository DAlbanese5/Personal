    <h1 id="header">Overview</h1>
    <p style="color: whitesmoke;">I was born and raised in Lancaster, OH. After high school, I went to a few different universities to play basketball. After college, I had the opportunity to go play professional basketball in Romania for a brief time. Covid is reason the season ended; so I came home and got into real estate. I started an investment company and also obtained my realtor license. I am published Author as well. The book was published in 2020. You can find it on Amazon (Link Below).</p>

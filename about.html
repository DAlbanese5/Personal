      I was born and raised in Lancaster, OH. After high school, I went to a few
      different universities to play basketball. After college, I had the
      opportunity to go play professional basketball in Romania for a brief
      time. Covid is reason the season ended and I cam home and got into real
      estate. I started an investment company and also obtained my realtor
      license.
